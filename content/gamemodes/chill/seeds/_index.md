## About Seeds

A seed is a unique identifier that generates the terrain, structures, and natural features of a Minecraft world. It determines the placement of biomes, ore deposits, villages, and other world generation elements.

## ⚠️ Important Rules

Getting locations based on pictures posted on Discord or any other medium using the seed, getting ores with the seed, or any form of technique—**excluding non-player structure finding and looting—is prohibited**. Please play fairly and discover your own resources!
