## 🏡 Home Management

| Command               | Action                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| ✏️ `/edithome <name>` | Rename, relocate, or add a description to a home. |

{{% steps %}}

1. **Set up your first base**
   Use `/sethome base` at your base to quickly return.

2. **Manage multiple homes**
   Keep homes for mines, farms, or builds with different names.

3. **Upgrade your rank**
   Start with 4 homes per server. Unlock more homes by purchasing a higher rank → [🌟 See Ranks](http://purevanilla.co/shop/cool).

## ⚰️ Respawn Mechanics

{{% hint warning %}}
If you die 💀, you respawn at your **bed 🛏️** or **respawn anchor 🔗** on your **main server**.
If no respawn is set, you appear at your **first saved home 🏡** in your main server (alphabetical order).
{{% /hint %}}

{{% steps %}}
1. **Primary respawn at bed or anchor**
   The game first tries to respawn you at your bed or respawn anchor if available.
2. **Fallback to your first home**
   If no respawn is set, the system falls back to your first home location.
3. **Safe random teleport**
   If death loop detected (>6 deaths/minute), performs a safe random teleport to prevent spawn camping.

## 🌍 Additional Teleport Options

Even without free home slots, you can use **lands** as teleport targets.

```
/lands spawn <claim>
```

{{% hint success %}}
Trusted or claimed lands give you extra teleport flexibility without requiring more home slots.
